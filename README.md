# Hudson Detailing - Harry Murphy Projects

## Aim

The aim of this project is to create a website for the clientâ€™s car detailing business. It's a new business, so a lot of communication is required between the client and me to ensure we get the business in a way that will attract business. Once the website is made to the client's requirements, assist him in creating other business requirements such as information posters and business cards in order to promote the business.
